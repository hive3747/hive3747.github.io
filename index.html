      <h3>Robotics</h3>
      <img src="./Sketchpad.png" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>Throughout middle and high school, I have been doing robotics. This year marks my fifth year. The experiences I've had and the lessons that I've learned are immesureable. I have been to the world competition twice, and placed third in the world once.  </p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <img src="./Sketchpad.png" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>While I still have quite a bit to learn, programming has been an interest of mine since fifth grade. I started with block coding in Scratch and EV3, then moved on to actual languages, such as C#, JavaScript, and Java. I am currently a mentor at Code Ninjas, and I teach kids aged 7-14 programming.  </p>
